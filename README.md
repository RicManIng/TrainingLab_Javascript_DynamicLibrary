# TrainingLab_Javascript_DynamicLibrary

## Objective
Create a web app to manage a book catalog using JavaScript. Users should be able to view a list of books loaded from a JSON file, filter books by category, and add new books to the catalog.

## Project Specifications

### HTML Structure
Create a basic HTML structure with the following elements:
- A section to display the list of books.
- A form to add new books with fields for title, author, and category.
- A dropdown menu to filter books by category.

### Loading Books from JSON File
Implement a JavaScript function to read a JSON file containing a list of books. Display the loaded books in a list on the site.

### Filtering Books by Category
Implement a filter functionality that allows users to view only the books of a selected category from the dropdown menu.

### Adding New Books
Implement a JavaScript function to add new books to the catalog through the form. Validate the data entered in the form before adding them to the catalog.

### Dynamic DOM Update
Ensure that the list of books in the DOM updates dynamically whenever new books are added or a filter is applied.

### Data Saving (optional)
Using the LocalStorage object, try to save the data locally in the browser.

## Technical Requirements
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Use a JSON file to load the initial book data.
- The web app must be responsive.
- Ensure that the site is functional and that all required features are correctly implemented.
